#This is the git ignore file if you want to use the free Unity 
# the ! negates an ignore, so you ignore everything in Library then
#un-ignore the metadata folder and those specific files
#use at your own risk.

#NOTE: this will cause your collaborators to re-import assets
# (previews and cache), but it seems to have no value to keep in source control

# This .gitignore file should be placed at the root of your Unity project directory
#
# Get latest from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore
#

# NOTES:
# A leading "**" followed by a slash means match in all directories. For example, "**/foo" matches file or directory "foo" anywhere, the same as pattern "foo". "**/foo/bar" matches file or directory "bar" anywhere that is directly under directory "foo".
# A trailing "/**" matches everything inside. For example, "abc/**" matches all files inside directory "abc", relative to the location of the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.
# A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories. For example, "a/**/b" matches "a/b", "a/x/b", "a/x/y/b" and so on.
# Your case matches the first one, so this line: **/.idea/ means: ignore .idea directory in any directory within the repository. So it would match /.idea/, /foo/.idea/, /foo/bar/.idea/ etc.
